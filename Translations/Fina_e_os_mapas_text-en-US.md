Fina is 12 years old.  

She loves technology and spending time on her tablet and her computer.  

But she doesn’t just use them to play games. Well, maybe a little... but what she likes most is researching and learning new things.

## Page 5

Fina goes everywhere on her bicycle.  
One of her favorite places to visit is her grandma’s house.  

“Grandma! I’m here! Are there cookies?”

## Page 6

Fina’s grandma lives alone, and Fina visits her often.  
She loves hearing stories about when her grandma was young and lived in America.  

Her grandma had many adventures.

And she also bakes delicious cookies.  

## Page 7

“Grandma! What happened?”
“I think the power’s out,” Grandma says calmly.
“Oh no... I wanted to look up that place you mentioned in your story, but my tablet's battery ran out.”
“Don’t worry! I think I have just the thing.”

## Page 8

“What’s that, Grandma?” Fina asks, curious.  
“These are books I brought back from America. I brought so many I don’t know where to put them all. There’s one here that will help you.”

## Page 9

“What book is that, Grandma?” Fina asks with bright eyes.  
“It’s an atlas! When I was young, maps could only be found in books like this. There were no modern gadgets like your tablet.”

## Page 10

“But Grandma, these maps are really old, and they didn’t have today’s technology back then.  
So how were maps made?”

“Well, cartographers drew them.”

“What do you mean they drew them?” Fina asks in amazement.  

Grandma laughs and starts to explain.

## Page 11

Cartographers collected information from many places to understand what the world was like.  
They talked to explorers, traders, and sailors who told them about their adventures, the routes they traveled, and how long it took to reach different places.  

## Page 12

Then, they took all of that information and made maps of the world, drawing them by hand. Back then, maps had lots of mistakes, but they also had very precise details that came straight from people who had been to those places.  

## Page 13

“But Grandma, making a map must have taken a lot of people,” Fina says thoughtfully.  

“Of course, Fina. Each person contributed a small but valuable piece of information, and together, they created maps of the world.”

## Page 14

“Bye, Grandma! I have so much research to do!” 
“I’m sure you'll learn plenty,” Grandma replies with a smile. 
“And take it slow on your bike. Let me know when you get home.” 
“Of course, Grandma!”

## Page 15

When Fina gets home, she runs to her room to research maps. One project catches her eye.  

It’s called OpenStreetMap, and it's described as “a world map created by people like you and free for everyone to use.”  

## Page 16

The next time Fina visits her grandma, she’s very excited.  
She can't wait to tell her about her discovery.

“Look, Grandma! While researching, I found this project.  
Through the Internet, anyone can help create a map of the world by drawing the places they know.  
It’s just like what you told me about the cartographers!”

## Page 17

“But now, with technology, it’s so much easier, Grandma. Look!  
I made an account, and now I can add information to the map. See? At home, I drew my school building, which wasn’t on the map, and added its name. Now it’s showing up on the map!”

## Page 18

“So you're a digital cartographer!” Grandma says proudly.  
“I think so, Grandma. But... you could be one too! Do you see anything missing from the map?”  

“Now that you mention it... I don’t see the center where I do pilates with my friends.”
“Let’s add it right now, Grandma!”

## Page 19

Together, they spend the rest of the afternoon adding places to the map. They even correct a few small mistakes they come across.  

Fina helps her grandma create her own account so that she can continue adding places using her computer. 

## Page 20

When they can’t think of anything else to add, they decide to go out for a walk and explore together.  
Fina brings her tablet and looks at OpenStreetMap while they walk around.  

Whenever they find a street or important place that’s missing, they stop to add it.  

## Page 21

The last thing they add is the candy store, where Fina buys some treats to snack on.  

“And what happens to the data we’re adding?”
“You'll see, Grandma. The data is free. Anyone can use it for whatever they want without paying or asking for permission. They just have to say where it came from.”

## Page 22

Grabbing the last candies from the bag, Fina asks,  
“Can we go for more walks like this, Grandma? I realized there’s still so much more to add to the map.”

Grandma gives her a loving hug and replies,  
“Of course, anytime you want. We’re cartographers now!”

If you liked our story and want to become a cartographer too,  
you can visit the OpenStreetMap website (https://openstreetmap.org/) and start mapping.  

Together, we can create a current and accurate world map,  
thanks to our local knowledge and collaboration.

The GHANDALF Association

We are a non-profit organization. We work on promoting open culture: Free Software, Free Hardware,  
and Open Data. To achieve this goal, we carry out all kinds of activities, organizing and collaborating on events,  
workshops, talks... wherever open culture is shared, you can find a “ghandalfeira.”

As a Galician association, we want to promote open culture and create  
more technical documentation in Galician. That’s why we undertake publishing and translation projects related to  
Free Software in Galician. Please check out our other publications.

We also think it’s very important to spread the values of Free Software and open culture among young people,  
which is why we organize talks and workshops in Galician educational centers.

If you want to collaborate on leveraging technology to improve society,  
the GHANDALF Association would be happy to offer you all the help we can.
